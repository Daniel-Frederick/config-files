3. Run this command in wezterm in *Adminastrator*
- `scoop bucket add extras; scoop bucket add nerd-fonts; scoop bucket add versions; scoop install neovim python ripgrep fd nodejs-lts lazygit fzf gcc imagemagick ghostscript tectonic FiraCode-NF`

4. [Install Lazyvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/installation)
- `git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\nvim`

5. Enter `nvim` and do `:checkhealth` to make sure everything is working and all dependencies are installed.

6. For Wezterm, you can customize it by creating a file called `.wezterm.lua` in `C:\Users\<YourName>`
- There is a simple file provided that will switch the base shell to Bash
